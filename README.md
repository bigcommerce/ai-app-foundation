# AI App Foundation

This [single-click app](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/apps/guide/types) presents BigCommerce merchants with the ability to generate product descriptions. It's also listed in our app marketplace.

:star2: This was originally open sourced as part of the Google <> BigCommerce AI Hackathon. Check out that event's [hackpack](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/big-ai-hackathon-2023/welcome) for more detail on Vertex AI and BigCommerce App Extensions. :star2:

## Install

1. [Use Node 18+ and NPM 8+](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm#checking-your-version-of-npm-and-node-js)
2. Install npm packages
   - `npm install`

## Usage

To run the app locally, follow these instructions:

1. [Add and start ngrok.](https://ngrok.com/download) _Note: use port 3000 to
   match Next's server._
   - `ngrok http 3000`
   - Get the `ngrok_id` from the **Forwarding** row. You will use it in the next step.
2. [Register a draft app.](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/docs/3ef776e175eda-big-commerce-apps-quick-start#register-the-app)
   - Enter app callbacks using the following syntax:
     - Auth Callback URL: `https://{ngrok_id}.ngrok.app/api/app/auth`, for example `https://12345.ngrok.app/api/app/auth`
     - Load Callback URL: `https://{ngrok_id}.ngrok.app/api/app/load`
     - Uninstall Callback URL: `https://{ngrok_id}.ngrok.app/api/app/uninstall`
   - Configure the following OAuth scopes as directed in [Setup:](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/app-extensions/guide#setup)
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`.
4. [Replace `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` in `.env`](https://devtools.bigcommerce.com/my/apps)
   (from `View Client ID` in the dev portal).
5. Update `AUTH_REDIRECT` in `.env` with the ngrok `install` callback URL.
6. Enter a JWT secret in `.env`.
   - JWT key should be at least 32 random characters (256 bits) for HS256
7. [Replace FIRE_API_KEY, FIRE_DOMAIN and FIRE_PROJECT_ID in .env](<[https://console.firebase.google.com](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/apps/tutorials/build-a-nextjs-sample-app/step-3-integrate#set-up-firebase-database)>)
8. [Replace GOOGLE_API_KEY= in .env](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/api-keys)
9. Start your dev environment in a **separate** terminal from `ngrok`. If
   `ngrok` restarts, update callbacks in steps 2 and 5 with the new ngrok_id.
   - `npm run dev`
10. [Install the app and launch.](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/docs/3ef776e175eda-big-commerce-apps-quick-start#install-the-app)
